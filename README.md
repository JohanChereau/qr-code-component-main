## My process
For this challenge, I didn't use any frameworks, just vanilla HTML and CSS. I've tried to respect HTML semantics as much as possible, and to produce clean, readable code that respects best practices. In particular, I used BEM notation and custom CSS properties.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM (Block, Element, Modifer)


### Useful resources
